# Exploratory Analysis of Netflix User Base Data

By leveraging the power of data analysis and engineering tools such as Matplotlib, Pandas, MisingNo, and Seaborn, an in-depth 
and visual exploration is conducted in order to discover key insights about age demographics, age, and gender distribution, 
subscription types, and so forth. This notebook might serve as a hands-on experience for beginners in the field of data science.

### ◘ Introduction  
The acquired dataset provides a sample Netflix user base, showcasing a plethora of monthly revenue, user subscriptions, 
activity, and account details. Each sample represents a unique user, identified by their identification as a user ID, and includes
information such as the subscription type which is categorized as Basic, Standard, or Premium. The revenue generated monthly 
from their subscription is also included along with the date of joining Netflix labeled as “Join Date”, the date of their last payment
as “Last Payment Date”, and the country in which they resided.

Additional columns have been included to provide insights into user behavior and preferences, which include the type of devices, 
case in point, Smart TV, Mobile phone, Desktop, and Tablet. Moreover, the total watch time (in minutes), and account status 
including whether the account is active or not is also provided. It can be used to analyze and model user trends, preferences, 
and revenue generation within a hypothetical Netflix user base.

### ◘ Objective
The primary incentive of this research is to:
* Process dataset by analyzing its integrity, missing values, duplicated values, and so forth.
* Perform various clean-ups, if required, and improve accessibility for more convenient exploratory analysis.
* Conduct exploratory analysis using a myriad of graphing tools to reach a conclusion.
* To reach a proper decision on which model to apply to the processed dataset in a future project to achieve the ideal optimization 
tuning and hopefully, a better outcome in the model's generalization.

### ◘ Approach
This research is classified into 2 steps:
1.	Data Wrangling: Where the dataset is extracted, tested, cleaned, processed, and stored in memory.
2.	Feature Analysis: Where the processed data is then explored thoroughly to acquire a viable insight.

<br/><br/>

### ◘ Methodologies & Technologies applied
* Diagnose and fix structural errors
* Check and Clean data
* Address duplicates & outliers
* Logical feature amalgamation to construct a unique variable
* Univariate inspection
* Bivariate inspection
* Feature correlations
* Seaborn & Matplotplib visualizations

### ◘ Installation (using pip)
In Jupyter, the console commands can be executed by the *‘!’* sign before the command within the cell. For example, If the following code is written in the Jupyter cell, it will execute as a command in CMD.
To intall any modules effectively, the sys python package is used and works as follows:
```
import sys
!{sys.executable} -m pip install [package_name]                               
```
1. For Pandas, run:
```
!{sys.executable} -m pip install pandas                                                  
```
2. To install missingNo:
```
!{sys.executable} -m pip install missingno                                                  
```
3. Matplotlib can be installed by running the following command:
```
!{sys.executable} -m pip install matplotlib
```
4. Lastly, for seaborn:
```
!{sys.executable} -m pip install seaborn
```

<br/><br/>

### ◘ Import Packages
To *import* the dependencies, simply open the preferred IDE or Notebook: 
1. For Pandas, run the following command:
```
import pandas as pd                                   
```
2. To use missingno, run:
```
import missingno as msn                                      
```  
3. Import matplotlib using:
```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt                                     
```
4. Seaborn can be accessed by:
```
import seaborn as sns                                      
```
